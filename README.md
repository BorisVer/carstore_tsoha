# carwebsite_tsoha

A car sale website, where users can
- log in
- make a new user
- add info to the user
- add a car for sale
- look for a car and filter cars by brand, model, year, mileage, gas type, transmition, drive train
- can chose in what order the results are filtered

Todo
- a liked search and liked car part
- remove cars from sale
- make interface better
- make it so after making a user it automatically asks for info, and show current info in the adding info tab

To test
- everyting should automatically start upon running the website for the first time. The starter.py is called the first time and makes all needed table and inserts all needed info from the start from the 4 json files
- in the routes.py you can disable the second part that creates 10 users and 10 cars for sale if needed for some reason
